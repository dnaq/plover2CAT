# Insert images

Images are supported in the Plover2CAT editor and for select export formats. In unsupported export formats, the image will be represented by the object replacement character.

1. Place the cursor at the position for insertion.
2. Navigate to the **Edit > Insert Image**. 
3. Select image file using the file selector dialog.
4. Click `OK` to confirm selection for insertion. 
5. Plover2CAT will copy the image to the `assets` folder.

Depending on the image's size, it may skew text and paragraph formatting. The image can be deleted through backspace like any ordinary character, and also cut/copy/pasted in the transcript.
