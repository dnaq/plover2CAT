# How to create a new style

Creating a new style is through **Styling > Create New Style** by first creating a copy of an existing style and then modifying it.

1. Position the cursor into a paragraph with the style you want to base the new style on. 
2. Click **Create New Style**. 
3. Enter new name of style in dialog window. 
4. Press `OK` to confirm the name after inputting the name. 

Right after new style creation, the style will be added to the list of style choices for `Current Paragraph Style`. At this point, it is possible to [modify the style properties](modstyle.md) as needed, including changing the parent style to inherit from and the next style.
