# How to set page size and margins

The page size is used to determine page size for supported export formats, and it also sets the width of the text in the editor. 

The page margins are not used in the editor when displaying text, only for exporting.

These page properties controls are located under `Page Format` in the `Toolbox` pane and are all in inch units. 

After making a change to to the properties, click `Change Page Layout` to apply and save the changes.
