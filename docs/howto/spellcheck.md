# How to do spellcheck

The `Spellcheck` page is located in the `Toolbar` dock. 

1. Select the desired dictionary (`en-US` by default) and press search. If there is a mis-spelling, the text is shown in the `detected` box. A list of candidate corrections is also displayed.

2. To not correct and move on to the next mis-spelling, press `Skip`. 

3. To not correct and also ignore all other occurrences, use `Ignore All`. This mis-spelling is remembered for the rest of the session.

4. If a correction is desired, select a choice from the list, and then press `Change`.
