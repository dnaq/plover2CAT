# How to set up and start audio recording

Plover2CAT can record audio through the computer's audio input if available. Video recording is not available.

To set up audio recording, go to the `Audio Recording` page in the `Toolbox` dock.

There are several dropdown menus which display the default choices based on the platform and operating system. See [audio controls on the docks reference](../reference/docks.md)

Press **Audiovisual > Record/Pause** to start recording. This is also available on the toolbar. Press again to pause. To stop recording, press **Audiovisual > Stop Recording** menu.

Once audio recording has started, the settings cannot be changed. For example, if audio recording is paused, no settings can be changed. Pressing **Stop Recording** will end all recording, and then the settings can be changed.

Plover2CAT only allows one audio file per transcript. Trying to record again will result in the previous file being over-written.
