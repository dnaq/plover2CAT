# How to Undo and Redo

Actions performed in the editor, such as writing and deleting can be undone, (**Edit > Undo**) and then subsequently redone (**Edit > Redo**). 

These actions are tracked and can be viewed in the History dock under `Session History`, with the most recent actions at the bottom. By scrolling up and clicking on previous actions, the user can undo up to that action, and by clicking a more recent action, redo them. Performing a new action after undoing others will cause those undone actions to be discarded.
