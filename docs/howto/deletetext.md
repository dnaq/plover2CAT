# How to delete text in the editor

When text is written to the editor through Plover, it is possible to "undo" by using the `*` key. However, sometimes partial deletions are needed. One way of removing text is with the `Delete` key. Plover2CAT will remove the character to the right of the cursor when the `Delete` key is pressed.

Another method for slightly larger deletions is to use the `Cut` function by selecting text and cutting it out without pasting it back in.
