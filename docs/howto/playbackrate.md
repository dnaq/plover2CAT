# How to set playback rate

The playback rate is the rate that the audiovisual file is being played at. 

Plover2CAT displays the playback rate in the Audio Controls dock, `1.0x` by default.

## Change playback rate

Click the up and down arrows in the playback rate box to increment the value by +/-0.05. It is also possible to hover the mouse over the input box and scroll to change the value. The playback rate is limited to a value between 0.05 to 2.

Plover2CAT has **Speed Up** and **Slow Down** under the **Audiovisual** menu. These buttons will increment the playback rate up/down. The benefit is that these menu items have shortcuts so it is possible to assign outlines to control the playback rate without needing to move away from the keyboard.
