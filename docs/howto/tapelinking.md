# Navigate to paper tape and back

The paper tape and the editor are linked through the data on the strokes.

Place the cursor in the editor text, and the paper tape automatically scrolls to the correct location.

To find text produced by a stroke, select the stroke in the tape. Then press the `Locate` button. The cursor will move to the text if text produced due to the selected stroke was not erased.
