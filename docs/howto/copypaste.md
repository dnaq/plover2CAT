# How to perform cut, copy, paste and normal copy in the editor

To keep steno data attached to text, Plover2CAT provides steno-aware cut, copy and paste functions. They have some differences compared to normal cutting/copying/pasting functions.


## Copy and cutting

Highlight the desired text and press **Edit > Copy** menu. This only functions if the selection is within the same paragraph, not across paragraphs. It is the same process with cutting text. Select text across paragraphs will not do anything.

## Paste

To paste, place the cursor at the desired position for insertion and then press **Edit > Paste** menu. The previously cut/copied text will be inserted and the steno data will also be inserted behind the scenes.

## Normal copy

`Normal Copy` will copy only the text. This is useful for selecting text within the editor to copy to another application. 

To paste from outside the editor into the editor, see [inserting normal text](insertnorm.md).

## Clipboard

The clipboard will hold the last five cut/copy entries. Click on each sub-menu item to paste the selected text.
