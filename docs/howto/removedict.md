# How to remove a transcript dictionary

Plover2CAT keeps track of the transcript dictionary (`dict/default.json`) and all other added custom dictionaries. 

The editor will load all added dictionaries into Plover when the transcript is opened. To remove a dictionary, use **Dictionary > Remove Transcript Dict**.

Select the dictionary in the file dialog that opens in the transcript's dictionaries directory. 

Plover2CAT will not load the removed dictionary the next time.
