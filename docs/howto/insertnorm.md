# How to insert normal text 

By default, Plover2CAT only allows writing through Plover to the editor, and not by the QWERTY keyboard. 

Click **Edit > Insert Normal Text** to insert normal text. Enter the text into the dialog window. This dialog accepts QWERTY keyboard input and also text from copying. 

When `OK` is pressed, the text in the input is inserted into the editor at the cursor position. 

This function can also be triggered by the `Insert` key.
