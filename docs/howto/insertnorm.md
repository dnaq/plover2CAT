# How to insert normal text 

Plover2CAT allows selected typing input when Plover is disabled. 

## Insert Text

1. Make sure Plover is disabled.
2. Set the cursor in the editor and type using the keyboard.

## Caveats

The keys `Enter`/`Return` cannot be used to create a new paragraph. Use `Split Paragraph` if necessary.

`Backspace` will remove the character before the cursor, but only if the cursor is not at the start of the paragraph. In other words, `Backspace` cannot be used to combine paragraphs. Use `Merge Paragraphs` if necessary.


## Mass Insert

Click **Edit > Insert Normal Text** to insert normal text. Enter the text into the dialog window. This dialog accepts QWERTY keyboard input and also text from copying. This will work regardless of whether Plover is enabled or disabled. 

When `OK` is pressed, the text in the input is inserted into the editor at the cursor position. 

This function can also be triggered by the `Insert` key.
