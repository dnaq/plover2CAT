# How to write even when window is not in focus

## Text output

By default, Plover2CAT only will write into the editor if the editor window is in focus.

 To enable writing even when the editor is not in focus (such as minimized window), capturing all output from Plover, go to **Steno Actions > Capture All Steno Output**. 
 
 To restore default behaviour, click it again.

 ## Paper tape

Strokes are logged to paper tape when **Capture All Steno Output** but window is inactive *with one exception*.

If the Plover machine set to "Keyboard", but output is not enabled, strokes are not logged since it is not possible to distinguish ordinary key presses from Plover-sent key presses.
